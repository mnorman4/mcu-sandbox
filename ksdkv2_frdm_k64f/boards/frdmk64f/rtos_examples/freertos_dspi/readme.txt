Overview
========
The freertos_dspi example shows how to use DSPI driver in FreeRTOS:

In this example , one dspi instance used as DSPI master with blocking and another dspi instance used as DSPI slave .

1. DSPI master sends/receives data using task blocking calls to/from DSPI slave. (DSPI Slave uses interrupt to receive/
send the data)


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.50.1
- Keil MDK 5.17
- GCC ARM Embedded 2015-4.9-q3

When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information on the terminal as below.

DSPI interrupt example start.
This example use one dspi instance as master and another as slave on one board.
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is:
DSPI_master -- DSPI_slave
   CLK      --    CLK
   PCS      --    PCS
   SOUT     --    SIN
   SIN      --    SOUT
DSPI master transfer completed successfully.

DSPI slave transfer completed successfully.

DSPI transfer all data matched!
